Gestart
=======

Gesture-based app launching widget for Android.

This app was an effort to simplify and expedite the favorite-app launching process for users. I believe gestures are a largely untapped reservoir of speed for app-launching. This app aimed to fix this problem.

I built this app in the Summer of 2012. It was a novice effort. Currently I am in the process of rebuilding this application with the following goals:

- Fix bugs and improve usability
- Follow better design principles, including reusable OO design
- Improve UI and overall app experience
- Incorporate outside Android libraries for both UX as well as backend functionality
